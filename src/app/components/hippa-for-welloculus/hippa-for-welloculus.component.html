                              HIPAA or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was passed by US Congress in 1996.  It outlines the requirements for the management, storage and transmission of protected health information (PHI) in physical and digital form. For healthcare related entities in the US, certain guidelines must be followed. Under Welloculus, we have summarized these guidelines for a simplified approach. These guidelines are what we at Welloculus understand by HIPAA compliance

                                   A Business Associate is a vendor or subcontractor who has access to PHI. The vendors can be data storage or document storage services (doesn’t matter if they can view the PHI that they maintain), providers of data transmission services, portals or other interfaces created on behalf of Covered Entities that allow patients to share their data with the Covered Entity, and electronic heath information exchanges.

                                   HIPAA hosting refers to website, application or data storage and hosting services that comply with the physical safeguard requirements of the HIPAA security rule. Hosting your application in a HIPAA compliant hosting environment such as Amazon AWS or Firehost does not make your application HIPAA compliant as they only address the physical safeguard requirements of the HIPAA security rule.

                                   HIPAA compliant hosting providers typically provide two main aspects of HIPAA compliance:

                                   It’s best to design your hosting environment with at least 2 web servers behind a load balancer and 2 database servers on an active/passive failover setup.

                                   The very premise of the HIPAA is to protect sensitive information, so it is paramount that you consider how you will communicate with subscribers once they are using your app.

                                   If you’re using notifications in your mobile app, it’s critical that you do not include any PHI in any push notifications from your app.

                                   In order to secure data on an iPhone (for example), users must use a passcode to lock the handset when not in use. You can’t control whether a user enables this functionality, but you can recommend that users who install your app enable the feature.

                                   An easy way to do this is suggest that the user turns on the passcode lock setting in your welcome email to new account holders.
